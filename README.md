Some of my linear algebra homework

## Libraries
I started off by using [linalg.js](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jdr/linalg_js/doc/) as the linear algebra engine, but decided that creating the classes/infrastructure myself would help me learn it better. So, for now, there's a strange mix between `lingalg.js` and my own custom classes.

I've made some changes to `linalg.js` in the `./linalg` directory, but for the most part it's the same.
